# Mediacells-Exercise

This repo contains my submission to the Mediacells Python Task

To run the code, I recommend setting up a local python virtual environment and install the requirements.txt.
```
$ python pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Submission 

My submission has been written in a python notebook and exports a JSON file titled 'stakeholder_summary.json'.
