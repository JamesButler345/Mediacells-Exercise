# Mediacells-Exercise

This repo contains my submission to the Mediacells Python Task.

### Submission 

My submission has been written in a python notebook and exports a JSON file titled 'stakeholder_summary.json'.

### Running the code
I recommend setting up a local python virtual environment and installing the requirements.txt.
```
$ python pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Execute code from within IDE (Eg: Visual Studio Code).
